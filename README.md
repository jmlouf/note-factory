# Note Factory
[![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

## Description
    
The Note Factory is a full-stack note taking application that allows users to write, save, view, and delete notes. It was built using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express on the backend and HTML, CSS, and BootStrap for basic styling on the frontend.

On the main notes page, the left sidebar displays a scrollable list of saved note titles. When a note title is clicked, the full note text is displayed in a readable format in the right text area. Users can enter new notes or modify existing notes using this text area as well.

This project demonstrates a straight-forward yet fully capable note taking web application built on Node.js and Express. The use of server-side data persistence ensures a seamless user experience for writing and managing personal notes.
